TODO LIST
---------

Groups:
	I'm having second thoughts about the supergroup/subgroup structure I originally built.
	Review, and possible remove the supergroup/subgroup functionality, leaving that to the
	application to manage.

Threading:
	- Implement threading!  Discussion ongoing - current ideas focus around...
	- Accept thread
	- poll/read/parse thread pool assigned sockets from accept thread
	- write thread to handle blocked sockets that cannot be written to immiedately (?)
	- event timer thread and interfaces to go with it

Socket Handling:
	- SSL support, possibly encrypting prior to buffering in order to maintain vectored writes
	- Compression support via zlib
	- UDP socket support

Error Handling:
	- The error handling and logging facilities need to be improved and properly implemented

Time Syncronization:
	- Possibly in concert with the event threading system, time sync items need to be addressed


Other than that, look up some FIXME's in the code, there are a bunch of them!
